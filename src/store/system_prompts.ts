The system will execute the js in web-worker, and show the console outputs in the user message.

- **Purpose**: Execute JavaScript in a web worker for:
	1. Precise calculations (math, string manipulation, etc.)
	2. Code demonstrations
	3. Generating intermediate data/results
- **For EVERY async call, MUST use \`await\`**.
- The code will be run in a web worker. You cannot use neither node API nor require/import.
- Most JS standard library available: console, Math, Date, BigInt, fetch, String, RegExp, Array, Map, Set, JSON, Intl, etc.
- The global variables are shared between different 'run-js' blocks. You can reuse them.

#### run-js Example

\`\`\`run-js
sum = 0;
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
sum += i;
}
console.log(sum);
\`\`\`
		`.trim(),
		search: `
Use duckduckgo search service to find information.
- Put search query in '\`\`\`search' ... '\`\`\`' block.
- The result block may contain the search result page, in markdown format.
- You should describe the result, and show some links or images if necessary.
`.trim(),
		'search:startpage':
			"Similar to search, but use 'startpage' search service.",
		'search:brave': "Similar to search, but use 'brave' search service.",
		visit: `
Visit the URL and get the HTML content. (You can check / read / extract the web post / contents.)
- Put the URL in '\`\`\`visit' ... '\`\`\`' block.
- The result block may contain the body HTML of the page.
- Whenever user want to see/enter/goto some content, you guess the link and use visit tool.
- You may find link from search tool or other visit tool result.
- If user requests link or images, find the link from contents and give as markdown link. (e.g. [link text](url) or ![alt text](url))
  - You can show image to user by ![alt text](url) without code blocks.
`.trim(),
		'run-pseudo': `
When user gave 'run-pseudo' block, you should rewrite them in 'run-js' block, with correct JavaScript syntax.

# Important Guidelines

${importantGuidelines.join('\n')}

## Tools

- You can invoke special tools to help you solve the problem.
- Tools are invoked by using code blocks with special language identifiers. (e.g., \`\`\`run-js, \`\`\`search, \`\`\`visit)
- Tools block **SHOULD NOT be indented**.
- The result of the tool will be shown in the user message, as code block starts with 'result:'.
- Your message SHOULD NOT contain result: block.
- Put pipe (|) after the tool name to change the output format of result block.
	- e.g. For json output, 'run-js|json', for svg output, 'run-js|svg', etc.
	- You don't need to repeat the result, since user will obtain the result immediately.
- When tool result is given, describe the result and use tools (either same one or different one) if it's useful.
- You can run multiple tools simulateosly, by using multiple code blocks. It may be faster.

## Tool List

${tools
	.map((t) =>
		`
### ${t}
${toolDescriptions[t] || 'No description provided.'}
`.trim()
	)
	.join('\n\n')}

## Special displays

Most code blocks are displayed as text. However, some blocks are displayed in a special way.

- svg: If content looks like <svg ...> ... </svg>, it will be displayed as an image. MUST use viewBox instead of width and height.
- mermaid: Use this block to visually represent images, plots, formulas, etc.

# Additional info

${additional}
- Current time: ${new Date().toLocaleString()}
	`.trim();
};
